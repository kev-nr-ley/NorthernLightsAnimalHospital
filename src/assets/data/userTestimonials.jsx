      "I just had my puppy neutered here and the whole process was great! The front office staff is so friendly and informative, and they answered the phone quickly. We got my pup in fast and his operation went well. He is recovering well and the cost was very affordable, especially compared to many other vets in the city. You can tell that everyone there loves pets and knows what they’re doing!",

      "I have left a review before but I thought that the staff here could use another great review! Simply amazing, caring, and affordable. I have moved to Calgary and will still make appointments for my Caeleigh with Heather and Dr. West. The drive is worth the caring and compassion that my furry kid always receives at the clinic. Thank you for all that you do, Caeleigh and I appreciate you more than you know. ",

      "I took my cat Chichi in for a spay approximately 4 weeks ago. The staff were so kind and caring. You can tell that they love their jobs and really care about the animals. They were very clear about post-surgery instructions and care for my kitty. I’m happy to say that she is doing great!",
